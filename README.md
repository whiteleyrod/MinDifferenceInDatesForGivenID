# MinDifferenceInDatesForGivenID
Find the minimum difference in dates for a given ID in a table
In a dataset that has an ID and Date column, find the minimum 
difference in dates for the current row's ID with any other row 
with the same ID. 
Write this data back to an Excel file, and also create a new 
table with the unique ID values and the minimum date difference 
for each ID
Script was written to solve a data transformation problem I had
where I have a table of values, (medical encounters in this case)
and I needed to figure out the number of times that someone came 
back for a repeat encounter within an arbitrary time period.
